v0.9.2.0
--------

Changes

All Platforms (except the .NET Micro Framework)
* Changed the way clients hook publish events to improve usability. Clients create a SubscriptionClient object which receives only the subscribed to events. Modeled after the Windows Azure Service Bus library.

Fixes

All Platforms
* Reading MqttMessage properties from publish message within a publish event will sometime cause a null reference exception.

.NET Micro Framework
* Calling DisconnectAsync on a disconnected client will deadlock the .NETMF socket adapter.



v0.9.1.0
--------

Fixes

All Platforms
* PublishString helper would prepend string length to string payloads. This is not expected when sending data to 3rd party online services. No longer prepening string length to payload strings.
* AdditionalErrorInfo not always propogating to clients.
* ConnectAsync never returned if server doesn't respond to Connect request. Error was sent through the NetworkError event. ConnectAsync has been changed to return an error in this case.

* Cleaned up debug output from sockets.



v0.9.0.0
--------

Additions

All Platforms
* SSL/TLS implementation.
* IsConnected property added to MqttClient class.
* Added AdditionalErrorInfo string property on event handlers. This is used to give extra error information if an exception is thrown when possible. Most useful on the .NET Micro Framework platform.

.NET Micro Framework
* New protocol setting: Hosts - a key/value dictionary containing strings for hostname/ip address pairs. This aids in hostname verification for TLS when DNS lookup is not available.

Changes

* Default network time-out reduced to 20 seconds.

Fixes

* .NET v4.5 Client crashing when attempting to subscribe to a topic on a disconnected client.
